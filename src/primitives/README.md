# Kirigami Primitives Module

This module contains types considered primitives, things that provide some basic
capability like rendering a certain shape. They don't require styling or at most
read a color value from the platform.

# What goes here

The following criteria should be used to determine if a type belongs here:

-   Types used as building blocks for other types.
-   Types are allowed to depend only on QtQuick.
-   Types are only allowed to depend on the Platform submodule.

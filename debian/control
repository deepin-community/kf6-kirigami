Description: set of QtQuick components targeted for mobile use
 Kirigami is a set of QtQuick components at the moment targeted for
 mobile use (in the future desktop as well) targeting both Plasma
 Mobile and Android. A set of high level components to make the
 creation of applications that look and feel great on mobile as well
 as desktop devices and follow the Kirigami Human Interface
